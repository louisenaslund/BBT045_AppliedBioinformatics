# Project for BBT045 AppliedBioinformatics by Group 7

The file Salmonpapaerproject.Rmd contains the code of the study. This code recreates parts of the article Jin Y, Olsen RE, Harvey TN, et al. Comparative transcriptomics reveals domestication-associated features of Atlantic salmon lipid metabolism. Mol Ecol. 2020;29:1860–1872. https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15446.

The files XX, XX and XX (I don´t know yet the names that these documents are going to have) are self-reflections written by each one of the members of the group who carried out the study. In these files, it is explained what is each one’s part in the study and what has been learned during the project.

The file SalmonProject.pdf (I don´t know yet the names that this document is going to have) is the document which collects all what has been done in the project. It contains an introduction about the project, the used methodology, the obtained results and the discussion of them.

The original article can be found in the Wiley Online Library, following the link https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mec.15446.

The original RNA-seq data (FASTQ-files) were obtained from ArrayExpress, E-MTAB-8306 - RNAseq of farmed and wild Atlantic salmon fed vegetable oil or fish oil or phospholipid diet from first feeding, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-8306/samples/.

Illumina TRUE-seq adapators were obtained from Illumina Adapter Sequences, https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/experiment-design/illumina-adapter-sequences-1000000002694-14.pdf.

FASTA-files with the Salmo Salar reference genome (ICSASG_v2) and GFF-file for the genome annotation were obtained from NCBI National Center for Biotechnology Information, https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/233/375/GCF_000233375.1_ICSASG_v2/GCF_000233375.1_ICSASG_v2_genomic.fna.gz and https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/233/375/GCF_000233375.1_ICSASG_v2/GCF_000233375.1_ICSASG_v2_genomic.gff.gz, respectively.
